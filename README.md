All my ponies are c+h so feel free to come sit with me, I do not bite :)

I have diagnosed Autism, so I would be very grateful if you could use tone tags (/j /srs /hj /nm etc) when telling jokes or talking to me! I also typing with a translator, so I’m sorry if you can’t understand; I will try my best! English is not my strong language.

I'm a White Lily Cookie fictive! <3

💬 - Looking to talk!

If you would like my discord, then feel free to ask me via whisper!

I don't mind who interacts with me as long as they don't fit into the Basic DNI criteria, e.g: Proshippers, racists, homophobic / transphobic people, etc.
